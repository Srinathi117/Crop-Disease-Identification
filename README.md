# Crop Disease Identification using Deep Neural Networks

## Overview

Crop diseases are a significant threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. Early identification of diseases can help farmers take timely action, reduce crop loss, and improve overall yield. This project aims to build a deep learning-based system that identifies crop diseases using images of crops. The system features a user interface (UI) where farmers can upload images of their crops, and the model will classify the image as healthy or identify any specific disease present.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project contains images of different crops, each labeled with the disease it might be suffering from. Common crop diseases such as leaf spot, blight, and rust are included in the dataset. The images are preprocessed to ensure they are of uniform size and quality for feeding into the deep learning model.

## Requirements

- Python
- Flask/Django (for web UI)
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for deep learning)
- Libraries: OpenCV, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pillow

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
